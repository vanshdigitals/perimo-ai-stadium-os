"""LLM abstraction: a mockable interface, an offline mock, and a Gemini client.

Design principles:
  * The rules engine resolves **all facts** before any LLM is involved; the LLM
    only phrases/translates those facts, so it cannot invent facilities.
  * The client is selected at startup: :class:`GeminiClient` when a key is
    present, otherwise :class:`MockLLM` — the app never crashes when the key is
    missing (graceful degradation).
  * Tests always use :class:`MockLLM`, so the suite runs fully offline.
