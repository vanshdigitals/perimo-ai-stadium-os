"""Time-based crowd simulation.

The base crowd level of each zone (from ``crowd.json``) is escalated or relaxed
according to ``minutes_to_kickoff``: gates and concourses surge as kickoff nears
and empty out once the match is underway. The mapping is deterministic, so it is
straightforward to unit-test.
